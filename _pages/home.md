### Welcome!

This <a href="https://www.nceo.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NCEO</a> funded project built a platform that provides ground lidar measurements and aerosol optical property retrievals at UK stations.
Ground lidar data provided at this site are in standard NetCDF format, and are aimed to support a wider scientific community.

Ground lidar measurements at satellite overpasses, if available, are further analysed for cal/val activities.
